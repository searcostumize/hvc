        <p>in a ,head. you put information about your website like what it is called ,title. or the icon it should have
            <b>,placeholder.</b>
        </p>
        <p>in a ,body. you put all the information about the website so everything visible right now for example</p>
        <p>divs make it so everything is sepereated and not on the same line</p>

        <h3>how to use types of text</h3>
        <span>this is a span and its supposed to be different then a ,p. in some way but im not sure yet</span>
        <p>this is a ,p. <b>this is an ,b. inside an p </b> next <i>this is an ,i.</i> next <u>this is an u</u> next
            <strong>this is an strong</strong> next <em>this is an em</em> end.

            whitch this i have yet to learn</p>

        <h3>how to use ,img.</h3>
        <p>you do ,img src="link to photo" alt="this is a photo".</p>
        <p>scr is to search for the image on the internet or on your computer</p>
        <P>alt is to describe the image if it is unable to be vieuwed</P>
        <p>it doesnt have a ,/. everything goes in one , .</p>
        <p>if the img is to big or too small you can change its size using height="...px" and width="...px"</p>
        <p>if you only change height then width will also change accordingly</p>

            <h1>you are curently at 1:25:00</h1>
        </a>
        <p>you can link words to a any website by using ,a herf="link". then some text whitch will provide the link ,/a.
            and by adding target="_blank" like so, ,a href".."target="_blank".</p>

        <h1>CSS</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; color: olive">how to use styles</h3>
        <p>using CSS ",h3 style="text-align: center". makes that h3 text align to the center</p>
        <p>adding a ; after every statement lets you add another for example "style="text-align: center; color: olive"</p>
        <p>but say if you want to make every h5 crimson you can do that in the <b>,head.</b> by doing ,style. h5[ color:=" crimson"] ,style.</p>
        <h5>like this</h5>
        <h5 style="color: purple">but it can be overwritten</h5>
        <p>you could also make another file for all the CSS and link this using the ,link.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>how to use id's and class</h3>
        <p>this is pretty complicated you can reffer to 1:16 if you dont understand. the difference between class and id is that ids can only be one thing and should be used for important things like a nav bar</p>
        <P> <span class="brown">class</span> you can in the ,style. adjust selected parts of the text using class for example if you say ,span class="brown". on one or multiple spans  you can</P>
        <p> in the ,styles. do ".brown[color: brown;] and this would make all texts with brown class brown.</p>
        <p> you can also give multiple text the class brown but only want to select the spans then span.brown[color: brown;]</p>
        <p><span class="brown">id's</span> are used to change things usualy parts of your document so divs, you can use id's by saying ,input id="navbar" </p>
        <p>then in the ,style. put #navbar[whatever you want to adjust]</p>
        <p>i will use some examples one being the image being consistantly displayed below filling the whole width yet height limited (using width 100% and height 100px) and the brown words</p>
